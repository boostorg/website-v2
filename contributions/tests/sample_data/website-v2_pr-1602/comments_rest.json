These might be a convenient advantage of nix. But nix is not the only solution:\r\n\r\n- Python virtual environments are a way to switch between multiple sets of python packages.  \r\n- nvm is a way to switch between multiple versions of node.\r\n\r\nThe reviewers tagged in this issue should weigh in. They will be using this on a regular basis. It's a comparison between \"I am comfortable with the current setup\" versus being enthusiastic about nix. Especially - if Julio, Rob, Chrissy could try this in real life, make an informed decision, and provide feedback/comments.          \r\n\r\nI wonder if both scenarios could continue to be supported (nix, not-nix).

    "body": "Testing nix, it seems to have many pros and cons, rather than being definitely a \"yes\" or \"no\". It's an interesting technology.\r\nHere are some points to consider.\r\n\r\n- We should be able to natively support Microsoft Windows. Currently that is possible in powershell or cmd. When working on the installers (in docs/scripts/) I tested both pure WSL, and powershell, and Powershell is overall much easier to use in conjunction with Docker Desktop, and everything works as expected for the end-user. It looks like nix doesn't support a Powershell environment.\r\n\r\n- Imagine 3-5 years from now, a new boost consultant needs to get up-to-speed and solve a Django bug. Their skill-set is perhaps django and frontend Javascript. They don't know nix (yet), but they are comfortable with docker-compose. A developer ought to be allowed to launch a plain docker-compose environment. Quick on-boarding for new staff. Perhaps they can get up to speed with nix later.\r\n\r\n- Most of boost.io is a python app embedded inside docker containers. That's running in docker-compose instead of the local shell. From that perspective, versions of local python or ruby packages are not the top main concern, they may be relevant in certain cases, such as when focusing on boost library doc builds, but the main tasks are inside docker, with python, and so local packages are less of an issue.\r\n\r\n- A new development environment ought to have \"Just\", and \"Docker Desktop\", and even (if that will be used) \"Nix\". There are good reasons to provide installer scripts that go through those steps. At that point, if that automation already exists, it's not much further to have it also install ruby or pip packages.\r\n\r\nThe choice doesn't need to be either/or though. In the same way as we'd like to support MacOS, Linux, and Windows, there could be options about nix or not.\r\n\r\nIn the Justfile, include more commands:\r\n- bootstrap (standard packages)\r\n- boostrap-nix (nix-based packages)\r\n\r\nIn the installer scripts (/docs/scripts/) prompt the user: \"Would you like to run a 'nix' based installation, or a 'standard' (non-nix) install?\"  Much of the script will still be valid in both cases.\r\n",
