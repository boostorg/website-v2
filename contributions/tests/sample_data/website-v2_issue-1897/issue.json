Looking around, openai has the best pricing at the moment with $0.05-$0.40 per million tokens for the gpt-5-nano model for what should be relatively simple tasks (or $0.025-$0.20 if the specific task isn't very urgent, as in the case of this ticket).\n\nPricing is available here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing?latest-pricing=standard\n\nThanks",
