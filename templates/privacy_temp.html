  information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics,

  The information we collect includes:<br />
  <br />
  Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage,

  collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP
  address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by
  refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on
  your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use

  <br />
  4. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?<br />
  <br />
  In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social
  media account, we may have access to certain information about you.<br />
  <br />
  Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
  third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter
  logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
  information about you from your social media provider. The profile information
  we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will
  often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as
  well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media
  platform.<br />
  <br />
  We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
  described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on
  the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not
  responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party
  social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to
  understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how
  you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.<br />
  <br />
  5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?<br />
  <br />
  In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the
  purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.<br />
  <br />
  We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for
  the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period
  is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal
  requirements).<br />
  <br />
  When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
  information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this
  is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
  stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
  information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
  possible.<br />
  <br />
  6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?<br />
  <br />
  In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
  organizational and technical security measures.<br />
  <br />
  We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational
  security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information
  we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
  information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
  storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise
  or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties
  will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal,
  or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your
  personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our
  Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a
  secure environment.<br />
  <br />
  7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?<br />
  <br />
  In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18
  years of age.<br />
  <br />
  We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of
  age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you
  are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor
  dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from
  users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the
  account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our
  records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children
  under age 18, please contact us at info@cppalliance.org.<br />
  <br />
  8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?<br />
  <br />
  In Short:  You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.<br />
  <br />
  Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your
  personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on
  the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
  You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the
  contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS
  NOTICE?" below.<br />
  <br />
  However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
  processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it
  affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on
  lawful processing grounds other than consent.<br />
  <br />
  If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us
  at info@cppalliance.org.<br />
  <br />
  9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES<br />
  <br />
  Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
  include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal
  your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
  monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
  recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do
  not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
  automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
  for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
  inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.<br />
  <br />
  10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?<br />
  <br />
  In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with
  relevant laws.<br />
  <br />
  We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will
  be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will be
  effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this
  privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of
  such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to
  review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting
  your information.<br />
