            <li>Lambda2 provides its own placeholders instead of importing the standard ones.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The review discussion touched on these pros and cons:
          </p>

          <p>Pros:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-5">
            <li>It's simple, clean, and elegant.</li>
            <li>lightweight, single header dependency</li>
            <li>Involves less typing</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Cons:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-5">
            <li>lambda and phoenix library have much larger functionality</li>
            <li>For complex lambda expressions, native C++ lambdas are more "future-proof"
            than boost::lambda2 expressions because you have the full range of the language available.</li>
            <li>Having to write using-declarations for each operator in each scope that they
            are intended to be used defeats the purpose.</li>
          </ul>


          <p>In the end, the pros outweighed the cons.</p>

          <p>There was also the concern that boost::lambda2 does not and cannot do short-circuiting
            of the && and || operators. I suggest writing a rationale and make it clear in the
            documentation. I think this is a major flaw.
          </p>

          <p>But the most glaring issue has to do with ADL: That Boost.Lambda2 defines the operators
            that should belong to namespace std::placeholders. Hence, the condition that Lambda2
            provides its own placeholders instead of importing the standard ones.
          </p>

          <p>
            There were also a couple of suggested improvements. I'll leave that up to Peter to
            decide whether to implement or not, since these suggestions are not conditions
            for acceptance.
          </p>

          <p>
            Again, thank you very much everyone, and thank you Peter for submitting this
            splendid library.

            The Boost formal review of the Lambda2, authored by Peter Dimov, starts Monday, March 22, 2021 to March 31, 2021 (inclusive).
          </p>

          <p>Documentation: https://pdimov.github.io/lambda2/doc/html/lambda2.html <br/>
              Source: https://github.com/pdimov/lambda2/
          </p>

          <p>
            Lambda2 is a simple, but functional, C++14 lambda library. It takes advantage
            of the fact that the standardÂ <functional>Â header already provides placeholders
            _1,Â _2,Â _3, and so on, for use withÂ std::bind, and function objects such
            asÂ std::plus,Â std::greater,Â std::logical_not, andÂ std::bit_xor, corresponding to
            arithmetic, relational, logical and bitwise operators.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please provide in your review information you think is valuable to
            understand your choice to ACCEPT or REJECT including Lambda2 as a
            Boost library. Please be explicit about your decision (ACCEPT or REJECT).
          </p>

          <p>
            Some other questions you might want to consider answering:
          </p>

          <ul class="list-disc ml-5">
            <li>What is your evaluation of the design?</li>
            <li>What is your evaluation of the implementation?</li>
            <li>What is your evaluation of the documentation?</li>
            <li>What is your evaluation of the potential usefulness of the library?</li>
            <li>Did you try to use the library? With which compiler(s)? Did you
            have any problems?</li>
            <li>How much effort did you put into your evaluation? A glance? A quick
            reading? In-depth study?</li>
            <li>Are you knowledgeable about the problem domain?</li>
          </ul>

            More information about the Boost Formal Review Process can be found
            at http://www.boost.org/reviews
          </p>

          <p>
            The review is open to anyone who is prepared to put in the work of
            evaluating and reviewing the library. Prior experience in contributing to
            Boost reviews is not a requirement.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thank you for your efforts in the Boost community. They are very much
            appreciated.
          </p>

          <p>
            Peter is often available in the CppLang Slack #boost channel should you
            require any clarification not covered by the documentation. I am not frequently
            available in the Slack channel, but I'll certainly pay attention to the discussions.
            Please don't hesitate to ping me if needed.
          </p>

            Cheers,<br />
