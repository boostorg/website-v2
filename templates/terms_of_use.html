  1. OUR SERVICES<br />
  <br />
  The information provided when using the Services is not intended for
  distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country
  where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which
  would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or
  country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from
  other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for
  compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
  The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations
  (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal
  Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions
  would be subjected to such laws, you may not use the Services. You may not use
  the Services in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).<br />

  <p>16.Â DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>
  <p>Binding Arbitration</p>
  <p>
    If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal
    negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below)
    will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU
    UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN
    COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and
    conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
    Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAAâs Supplementary
    Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of
    which are available at the American Arbitration Association (AAA) website.
    Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be
    governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the
    AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be
    excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration
    may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone,
    or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not
    provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The
    arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if
    the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the
    applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in
    United States, California. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties
    may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending
    arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award
    entered by the arbitrator.
  </p>
  <p>
    If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the
    Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in thestate and federal
    courtslocated in United States, California, and the Parties hereby consent
    to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non
    conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal
    courts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
    International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction
    Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Legal Terms.
  </p>

  <p>
    In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to
    the Services be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action
    arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then
    neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that
    portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such
    Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the
    courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the
    personal jurisdiction of that court.
  </p>

  <p>Restrictions</p>

  <p>
    The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
    between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a)
    no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no
    right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis
    or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or
    authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative
    capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
  </p>

  <p>Exceptions to Arbitration</p>

  <p>
    The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above
    provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to
    enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual
    property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from,
    allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and
    (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be
    illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any
    Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or
    unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
    jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the
    Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
